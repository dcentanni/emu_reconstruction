## MIC3
Microscope 3 has undergone 6 correction sets since the SND data-taking start, so far (last update 04/06/24)
- First corrections made in August 2021, named `mic3_2021`
- Second set of corrections made in February 2023, named `mic3_15_Feb_2023` due to the break of the stage, ***but no correction matrices done**
- Third set of corrections, made in November 2023, named `mic3_24Nov23`
- Fourth set of corrections, made in February 2024, named `mic3_9Feb24`
- Fifth set of corrections, made in April 2024, named `mic3_4Apr24`, due to several changes: lamp got replaced, revolver removed and magnetic frame installed
- Sixth set of corrections, made in May 2024, named `mic3_8May24`, due to oil leaking onto the encoder

### February 2023 corrections
This set of corrections applied only to flatview and grainvol, so apparently no further correction matrices have been evaluated.
